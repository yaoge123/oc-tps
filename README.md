## Installation

Install from the CLI:

```bash
opencode plugin add oc-tps@latest
```

## Live TPS accuracy

The live number is the only estimated one. Deltas are counted in UTF-16 code units (`String.length`, the same unit opencode uses for its own fallback estimate) and multiplied by a tokens-per-character ratio. A character is not a token, and the two streams do not even share a ratio: reasoning is mostly ASCII prose, while the visible output of a CJK session is mostly CJK. So `reasoning` and `text` are calibrated - and used - separately. Each ratio starts from a rounded seed (`0.3` for reasoning, `0.5` for text; measured against real traffic a reasoning step runs at ~0.25-0.31 tokens per character while a text step runs at ~0.48-0.61 depending on the language) and is re-learned from the provider-reported counts in `session.step.ended` with an exponential moving average. A stream only learns from the tokens it produced itself, so a step that is pure reasoning cannot drag the text ratio around, and observations outside `0.15-1.5` tokens per character are dropped rather than clamped: a tool call puts its arguments into the output token count without ever streaming them as text, which reads as several tokens per character (3.1 was measured) and would otherwise drag the text ratio up for the rest of the session.

`AVG` and `TTFT` never estimate - they use the provider token counts and the event timestamps. `AVG` is session-cumulative: it spans every step of the session, it never resets, and its duration excludes tool execution time. That is why it deliberately disagrees with the per-message `tok/s` opencode prints at the end of each assistant message.

Set `showCalibration` to append the ratios the live estimate is currently using, again reasoning first: `TPS 74.2 (0.28/0.56)`. They are not measurements, they are the numbers behind the estimate, and they are printed for exactly that reason - so the estimate can be audited. Set `showStreams` to print the speed of each stream next to the average: `AVG 61.8 (74.2/238.1)`. Each component is measured over its own streaming span - the first to the last delta of that stream - so these are the speeds of reasoning and of output rather than their shares of the total, and they deliberately do not add up to the average in front of them. Reasoning is usually the slower one, because it arrives in bursts with pauses in between. A step only contributes to a stream's number when that stream actually streamed for at least 250ms, which matters for the output number in particular: the arguments of a tool call are reported as output tokens but never arrive as text deltas, so without that rule a tool-heavy session would report an absurd output speed.

### Options

Pass them through the plugin entry in `cli.json`:

```json
{ "plugins": [{ "package": "oc-tps@latest", "options": { "windowMs": 2000 } }] }
```

| option | default | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `windowMs` | `1000` | rolling window used for the live rate |
| `liveStaleMs` | `1500` | show `-` when no delta arrived for this long |
| `minSamples` | `2` | minimum deltas in the window before a rate is shown |
| `minWindowMs` | `250` | minimum window span before a rate is shown |
| `calibrationAlpha` | `0.3` | EMA weight of a new tokens-per-character observation |
| `liveSmoothing` | `0.4` | EMA weight applied to the live rate itself |
| `tickMs` | `250` | how often the window is re-evaluated while idle |
| `initialTokensPerChar.reasoning` | `0.3` | starting reasoning ratio until the model has been seen |
| `initialTokensPerChar.text` | `0.5` | starting text ratio until the model has been seen |
| `showCalibration` | `false` | print the live tokens-per-character ratios after TPS as `(reasoning/text)` |
| `showStreams` | `false` | print the speed of each stream next to the average as `total (reasoning/output)` |

`initialTokensPerChar` also accepts a single number, which is applied to both streams.
